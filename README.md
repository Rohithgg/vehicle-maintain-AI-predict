# Vehicle Maintain AI Predict

This project is a supervised learning model designed to assist in vehicle autopilot and driver assistance. It includes various features such as ABS (Anti-lock Braking System), predictive maintenance, vehicle engine health monitoring, and more. Please note that this is a simulation project and is not implemented in real life.

## Features

- **Autopilot Assistance**: Helps in driving the vehicle autonomously.
- **ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)**: Prevents the wheels from locking up during braking.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predicts maintenance needs to avoid unexpected failures.
- **Engine Health Monitoring**: Monitors the health of the vehicle's engine.

## How It Works
_Note that this is done in simulation, and it needs to be tested for real-life cases, which includes IoT and model computing in embedded systems and etc._

The model uses data collected from various sensors installed in the vehicle. This data is processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to provide real-time assistance and predictions. The main components include:

- **Data Collection**: Sensors collect data on vehicle speed, engine performance, brake pressure, engine temperature, etc.
- **Data Processing**: The collected data is processed and cleaned for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A supervised learning model is trained on historical data to make predictions and assist the driver.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors the vehicle's performance and provides alerts and assistance as needed.
- **IoT for Monitoring**: Reading sensors in vehicle used for monitors and updating and displaying in moblie 
- **Simulation testing**: This project is testing in simulation using Airsim.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for data analysis and model training.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the model and processing data.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch are used for building and training the machine learning models.
- **Sensor Data**: Data from various sensors installed in the vehicle is used for analysis and predictions.
- **Simulation**: Test simulation by using Airsim.
- **Moblie**: App for user interface and displaying results in there. 

## Potential Development

This project is currently under development, and there are several areas for potential improvement and expansion:

- **implementation in real life**: moving from simulation to actually using and testing in real vehicles.
- **Enhanced Autopilot Features**: Adding more advanced autopilot capabilities.
- **Advanced Predictive Maintenance**: Improving the predictive maintenance algorithms to cover more vehicle components.
- **Integration with External Systems**: Integrating the system with external systems such as navigation and traffic updates for better assistance.
- **User Interface**: Developing a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the system.

## Demo

## Use Cases
- **Autopilot for Long Trips**: Enhances driver comfort and safety by taking over driving tasks during long trips.
- **Preventive Maintenance Alerts**: Notifies the driver of upcoming maintenance needs to avoid unexpected breakdowns.
- **Real-time Engine Monitoring**: Provides real-time data on engine health, allowing for quicker diagnostics and repairs.
- **Safety Enhancements**: Improves vehicle safety with real-time monitoring and alerts for potential issues.
